This paper examines the critical role of schema evolution in data lake environments, addressing common problems and presenting solutions through open-source projects, focusing on Apache Iceberg. Data lakes, characterized by their vast storage capabilities and flexibility in handling diverse data types, face unique schema management challenges due to the dynamic nature of data sources. Schema evolution, or adapting database schema over time, becomes essential in maintaining data integrity, supporting new analytic requirements, and ensuring data governance. However, schema evolution in data lakes encounters specific issues such as schema drift, metadata scalability, and performance degradation during schema changes. We explore how Apache Iceberg and other projects like Delta Lake and Hudi offer robust solutions for managing schema evolution effectively. These include transactional support, scalable metadata management, and schema versioning, which ensure data lakes can evolve without compromising data quality or system performance.

## Introduction

Schema evolution refers to the iterative process of modifying a database's schema to accommodate changes in data structure, requirements, and analytical needs without compromising data integrity or application functionality. Schema evolution poses unique challenges in the context of data lakes, which store vast amounts of structured and unstructured data. Data lakes serve as a central repository for raw data, making them inherently more flexible and susceptible to issues like schema drift, where the structure of incoming data changes unpredictably over time. Additionally, the need for scalability, data governance, and query performance further complicates schema evolution in data lakes.

The advent of open-source projects such as Apache Iceberg, Delta Lake, and Hudi has introduced new methodologies for addressing these challenges. These projects provide mechanisms for schema versioning, backward and forward compatibility, and efficient metadata management, which are crucial for maintaining the integrity and usability of data lakes. Apache Iceberg, in particular, stands out for its innovative approach to handling schema evolution, offering solutions that mitigate common problems associated with data lakes. This paper delves into the necessity of schema evolution in data lakes, identifies the issues it aims to solve, and evaluates how Apache Iceberg and similar open-source projects contribute to resolving these issues. Through this exploration, we aim to highlight the importance of schema evolution strategies in ensuring the long-term viability and effectiveness of data lake environments.

## The Necessity of Schema Evolution in Data Lakes

Data lakes have become integral to organizations seeking to capitalize on the vast amounts of data generated from various sources. These repositories accommodate a wide array of data types, from structured to unstructured, enabling comprehensive analytics and insights. However, the dynamic nature of data generation and acquisition imposes significant challenges, particularly in schema management. Schema evolution emerges as a crucial process in this context, ensuring that data lakes remain flexible, scalable, and relevant to evolving business and analytical needs.

### Dynamic Data Sources and Formats

Data lakes ingest data from diverse sources, each with its unique format and structure. As businesses evolve, so do their data sources, introducing new data types or altering existing formats. Schema evolution allows data lakes to adapt to these changes seamlessly, incorporating new data types without disrupting existing analytics and applications. Without such mechanisms, data lakes risk becoming obsolete, filled with outdated or incompatible data formats that hinder analysis.

### Scalability and Flexibility Requirements

The essence of a data lake lies in its ability to store petabytes of data and scale according to organizational needs. This scalability extends to schema management, where the ability to evolve schemas without extensive downtime or performance degradation is paramount. Schema evolution ensures that as data volume grows and diversifies, the underlying schema can adjust accordingly, maintaining system performance and query efficiency.

### Data Governance and Quality Control

Effective data governance ensures that data within the lake remains accurate, consistent, and accessible. Schema evolution plays a pivotal role in data governance by enabling the enforcement of data quality rules and standards as data evolves. For instance, adding new constraints or fields to a schema as part of governance policies requires schema evolution capabilities. Without it, ensuring data quality and compliance with regulatory standards becomes challenging, potentially leading to data integrity issues.

### Supporting New Analytical Requirements

The analytical needs of an organization are never static; they change to reflect new business objectives, market conditions, and technological advancements. Schema evolution facilitates the introduction of new data models and structures to support these emerging analytical requirements. It allows data lakes to remain relevant and valuable, providing the necessary data structures for new types of analysis and reporting.

## Problems in Data Lake Schema Evolution

While necessary, schema evolution in data lakes presents a host of challenges that complicate data management and utilization. These problems stem from the inherent characteristics of data lakes, such as their scale, diversity of data, and the flexibility they offer. Addressing these issues is crucial for organizations to ensure their data lakes remain effective and efficient repositories for analytics and decision-making.

### Schema Drift and Inconsistency

One of the primary challenges in data lake schema evolution is schema drift, where the structure of incoming data changes over time without explicit governance. This drift can lead to data format and quality inconsistencies, making it difficult to perform reliable analytics. Schema drift often occurs in environments with multiple data sources contributing to the lake, each evolving independently. Managing this drift requires sophisticated schema evolution strategies to adapt to changes while maintaining data integrity dynamically.

### Data Versioning and Backward/Forward Compatibility

As schemas evolve, maintaining backward and forward compatibility becomes a significant challenge. Backward compatibility ensures that new data adheres to older schema versions for compatibility with existing applications and analytics. Forward compatibility, conversely, allows older data to be compatible with new schema versions. Achieving both requires meticulous planning and execution of schema changes, often necessitating complex versioning mechanisms to track and manage schema iterations over time.

### Metadata Management at Scale

Data lakes store vast amounts of data, necessitating efficient metadata management to ensure quick access and analysis. Schema evolution complicates metadata management, as each schema change requires updates to metadata to reflect new structures, fields, or data types. Managing this metadata at scale, especially in rapidly evolving environments, poses significant performance, consistency, and storage challenges.

### Performance Implications of Schema Changes

Implementing schema changes in a data lake can have direct implications on performance. Large-scale schema modifications may require extensive data transformation or migration, leading to downtime or reduced performance. Maintaining compatibility layers or versioning can add overhead to data access and query execution times. Balancing the need for schema evolution with the performance requirements of data lake operations is a critical challenge for data engineers and architects.

## Problems

Schema evolution in data lakes introduces several challenges that can complicate data management and utilization. These issues primarily stem from the vast scale and diversity of data within data lakes, alongside the need for flexibility in handling this data. By exploring specific examples and scenarios, we can better understand the complexities of schema evolution within these environments.

### Schema Drift and Inconsistency

**Example:** A data lake collects event data from various sources, including web applications, IoT devices, and mobile apps. Each source periodically updates its data format - for instance, a mobile app adds a new field, `deviceBatteryLevel`, to its event logs. Without a coordinated schema evolution strategy, these incremental changes lead to schema drift, resulting in inconsistent data that complicates analysis and querying.
**Scenario Illustration:** Initially, the schema for event data might look like this:

```json
{
	"eventType": "click",
	"eventTime": "2021-07-01T12:00:00Z",
	"userId": "user123"
}
```

After the schema drift, new event data might include additional fields:

```json
{
	"eventType": "click",
	"eventTime": "2021-07-01T12:00:00Z",
	"userId": "user123",
	"deviceBatteryLevel": 85
}
```

This discrepancy creates challenges in querying and aggregating data, as analysts must account for the presence or absence of new fields across different periods.

### Data Versioning and Backward/Forward Compatibility

**Example:** A data lake undergoes a schema change to split a fullName field into firstName and lastName for more detailed user analysis. This change requires maintaining backward compatibility for applications still using the fullName field and forward compatibility for new applications expecting the split fields.
**Scenario Illustration:** Original schema:

```json
{
	"userId": "user123",
	"fullName": "Jane Doe"
}
```

After schema evolution, new records follow a different format:

```json
{
	"userId": "user123",
	"firstName": "Jane",
	"lastName": "Doe"
}
```

This evolution necessitates versioning mechanisms to manage and access different data versions, complicating data retrieval and analysis.

### Metadata Management at Scale

**Example:** The metadata describing these schemas grows exponentially as the data lake's schema evolves to include new data sources, each with its unique schema. This growth challenges the data lake's ability to manage and query metadata efficiently, impacting overall system performance.
**Scenario Illustration:** Initially, the metadata might catalog a manageable number of schemas. However, as new sources are added and existing ones evolve, the catalog expands significantly, encompassing hundreds or thousands of distinct schema versions. This expansion necessitates robust metadata management systems capable of handling the scale and complexity of the information.

### Performance Implications of Schema Changes

**Example:** A data lake implements a schema change that requires reprocessing historical data to fit the new schema format. This resource-intensive reprocessing task leads to an increased load on the data lake's infrastructure and potential performance degradation for other operations.
**Scenario Illustration:** Consider a schema change that adds a new column category to a large dataset containing billions of records. Implementing this change might involve scanning and updating each record to include the new column. This process could significantly impact query performance and data ingestion rates during the transition period.

## Open-Source Projects for Schema Evolution in Data Lakes

Apache Iceberg provides robust mechanisms for schema evolution, allowing data engineers to implement changes efficiently while ensuring data integrity and compatibility. This section demonstrates practical implementations and code examples of schema evolution tasks using Apache Iceberg, highlighting its flexibility and power in managing complex data lake environments.

### Adding a New Column

One common schema evolution task is adding a new column to an existing table. Apache Iceberg allows this operation without affecting the current data, ensuring backward compatibility.

**Code Example:**

```java
import org.apache.iceberg.Schema;
import org.apache.iceberg.types.Types;

// Assuming table is an existing Iceberg table
Schema updatedSchema = new Schema(
    table.schema().columns(),
    Types.NestedField.optional(3, "new_column", Types.StringType.get())
);

table.updateSchema().addColumn("new_column", Types.StringType.get()).commit();

```

This code snippet demonstrates how to add an optional column named `new_column` of type `String` to an existing table. Iceberg's schema evolution operations are transactional, ensuring that the schema update either fully applies or rolls back in case of failure, thus maintaining data integrity.

### Renaming a Column

Renaming a column is necessary when aligning data models with evolving business terminologies or correcting previous design decisions. Iceberg supports column renaming directly without impacting the data stored.

**Code Example:**

```java
// Rename column from "old_name" to "new_name"
table.updateSchema().renameColumn("old_name", "new_name").commit();

```

This operation changes the column name in the schema, with Iceberg handling the underlying metadata adjustments to reflect this change, ensuring that data access and queries continue to work seamlessly.

### Deleting a Column

Removing obsolete or unnecessary data fields helps optimize storage and improve query performance. Iceberg safely allows column deletion, ensuring that existing data is not compromised.

**Code Example:**

```java
// Delete column "unnecessary_column"
table.updateSchema().deleteColumn("unnecessary_column").commit();
```

Deleting a column with Iceberg updates the schema while preserving the integrity and accessibility of the remaining data. This operation is crucial for maintaining lean and relevant data models over time.

### Evolution of Complex Types

Schema evolution often involves complex types, such as nested structures or arrays. Iceberg's comprehensive type system and schema evolution capabilities support modifications within these complex structures.

**Code Example:**

```java
// Add a new field to a struct within an existing column
table.updateSchema()
    .addColumn("user_info.address", Types.NestedField.optional(4, "postcode", Types.StringType.get()))
    .commit();
```

This example adds a new field postcode to a nested struct address within the column `user_info`. Iceberg's support for deeply nested schema changes simplifies the management of complex data models, enabling granular evolution of data structures.

### Time Travel Query

Apache Iceberg's time travel feature allows querying data as it was at a specific time, enabling data auditing and historical analysis.

**Code Example:**

```java
TableIdentifier identifier = TableIdentifier.parse("my_catalog.my_db.my_table");
Table table = CatalogUtil.loadTable(HadoopCatalogs.create(conf), identifier);

// Query data as of a specific snapshot
DataFrame historicalData = spark.read()
    .format("iceberg")
    .option("snapshot-id", table.snapshot(1234567890L).snapshotId())
    .load("my_catalog.my_db.my_table");
```

By specifying a snapshot ID, users can access historical data, facilitating audits and understanding the impact of schema evolution over time.
