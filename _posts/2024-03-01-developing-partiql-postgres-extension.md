## Abstract

This paper introduces a novel PostgreSQL extension designed to incorporate PartiQL's query execution capabilities, enabling PostgreSQL to handle and execute queries over relational and non-relational data seamlessly. Despite PostgreSQL's widespread use and compliance with SQL standards, it traditionally faces challenges in efficiently managing non-relational data types, such as nested and semi-structured data. PartiQL, an SQL-compatible language that extends traditional SQL to cover non-relational data, provides an opportunity to overcome these limitations, though PostgreSQL does not natively support it.

The proposed extension, "pgpartiql," bridges this gap, enhancing PostgreSQL's functionality to include the execution of PartiQL queries. Focusing on performance, "pgpartiql" ensures the efficient processing of these queries without sacrificing PostgreSQL's execution efficiency. The extension aims to simplify data operations, improve analytical flexibility, and maintain high query performance, significantly advancing PostgreSQL's ability to handle a wider array of data types and structures. Through "pgpartiql," users gain a powerful, integrated tool for advanced data management within the PostgreSQL ecosystem.

## Introduction

PostgreSQL, an open-source relational database, is known for its robustness and compliance with SQL standards. PartiQL, a query language that extends SQL to handle structured, semi-structured, and nested data, addresses the need for flexible data querying in modern data ecosystems. However, directly executing PartiQL queries within PostgreSQL environments is not supported, creating a gap in seamlessly querying across diverse data models. This paper introduces the development of a PostgreSQL extension to enable PartiQL query execution, aiming to enhance PostgreSQL's adaptability to contemporary data management challenges. The proposed extension focuses on maintaining high performance and scalability for PartiQL queries, facilitating efficient data integration, migration, and analysis. By integrating PartiQL's capabilities into PostgreSQL, this initiative strives to offer users a unified, efficient solution for complex data operations, combining PostgreSQL's reliability with PartiQL's versatile querying approach.

## Background

### PostgreSQL Extensions

PostgreSQL, an advanced open-source object-relational database, has a long history of extensibility, allowing it to incorporate additional functionalities beyond its core capabilities. Extensions in PostgreSQL are modules that can be loaded into the database to add new features such as data types, functions, operators, and index types. This extensibility framework makes PostgreSQL adaptable to a wide range of data management needs, catering to various industry requirements.

### Introduction to PartiQL

PartiQL is an extension of SQL that provides a unified approach to querying data, irrespective of its shape or origin. It extends SQL's relational algebra to seamlessly operate on traditional relational data and modern non-relational data models, including nested arrays and objects. PartiQL's syntax remains consistent with SQL, ensuring familiarity for users, while its expanded capabilities address the complexities of contemporary data ecosystems.

### Challenges in Current PostgreSQL Data Handling

While PostgreSQL excels in managing structured, relational data, its capabilities around non-relational data types and complex nested structures are limited. The traditional approach involves manually flattening nested data or implementing custom functions for specific operations, which can be inefficient and cumbersome. This limitation becomes more apparent as the diversity and complexity of data increase, particularly with the rise of semi-structured and unstructured data in enterprise applications. The current scenario necessitates frequent context switching and additional data processing steps for users working across different data models, leading to increased development time and potential for errors.

Integrating PartiQL into PostgreSQL via the proposed extension aims to address these challenges directly. By enabling native support for PartiQL queries, PostgreSQL can offer a more flexible and efficient approach to data querying and manipulation, reducing the need for external data processing and simplifying interactions with non-relational data. This extension enhances PostgreSQL's inherent capabilities and aligns it more closely with the evolving needs of modern data applications, ensuring that it remains a competitive and versatile choice for data management in various scenarios.

> Given the constraints and context provided earlier, direct implementation details, especially involving specific programming languages or technologies like C, Rust, or PartiQL integration specifics, are out of scope for this paper.

### Step 1: Developing the Extension

#### A. Define the Extension's SQL Wrapper

Create a SQL file (e.g., `pgpartiql--1.0.sql`) that PostgreSQL will use to load the extension. This file should define the wrapper functions that PostgreSQL will call to interact with the PartiQL parser and Scribe translator.

```sql
-- Define a function to execute PartiQL queries
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION execute_partiql(query TEXT) RETURNS SETOF RECORD AS $$
BEGIN
    -- Placeholder for calling the PartiQL parser and Scribe translator
    -- Actual implementation will involve invoking external libraries or custom code
    RETURN QUERY EXECUTE translate_and_execute(query);
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

#### B. Implementing Translation Logic

Assuming you have a C or Python module for interfacing with PartiQL's parser and Scribe, you'll need to write a function that PostgreSQL can call. Here's a pseudo-implementation in C for a function that translates and executes a PartiQL query:

```c
#include "postgres.h"
#include "fmgr.h"
#include "utils/builtins.h"

PG_MODULE_MAGIC;

PG_FUNCTION_INFO_V1(execute_partiql);

Datum
execute_partiql(PG_FUNCTION_ARGS)
{
    char* partiql_query = TextDatumGetCString(PG_GETARG_DATUM(0));

    // Placeholder for PartiQL query translation and execution
    // This would involve calling the PartiQL parser and Scribe translator
    // and then executing the resulting SQL query against PostgreSQL

    PG_RETURN_TEXT_P(cstring_to_text("Result placeholder"));
}
```

### Step 2: Packaging the Extension

Create a control file (`pgpartiql.control`) to define the extension metadata:

```
# pgpartiql.control
name = 'pgpartiql'
default_version = '1.0'
comment = 'Execute PartiQL queries in PostgreSQL'
```

### Step 3: Installing the Extension

1. **Compile Custom Code**: If your extension includes custom C code, compile it into a shared library (`.so` file on Linux) and place it in PostgreSQL's library directory.

2. **Deploy SQL and Control Files**: Move your SQL file (`pgpartiql--1.0.sql`) and control file (`pgpartiql.control`) to the PostgreSQL's extension directory.

3. **Register the Extension**: Log into your PostgreSQL database and run:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION pgpartiql;
```

### Step 4: Using the Extension

Once installed, you can use the `execute_partiql` function to run PartiQL queries directly within PostgreSQL:

```sql
SELECT * FROM execute_partiql('SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE id > 10');
```

## Evaluation

After developing the "pgpartiql" extension, a comprehensive evaluation is essential to ensure its effectiveness, performance, and compatibility within the PostgreSQL ecosystem. This section outlines the methodologies and metrics for assessing the extension's impact on PostgreSQL's functionality and performance, especially when executing PartiQL queries.
