## Abstract

This paper presents a new PostgreSQL extension, "pgpartiql," that integrates PartiQL's query execution into PostgreSQL, allowing it to process structured, semi-structured, and nested data. While adhering to SQL standards and enjoying widespread adoption, PostgreSQL has historically struggled with managing non-relational data types like nested and semi-structured data. PartiQL offers a solution by extending SQL capabilities to encompass non-relational data, yet PostgreSQL lacks native support.

The "pgpartiql" extension addresses this deficiency by expanding PostgreSQL's capabilities to execute PartiQL queries, focusing on maintaining high performance. This extension aims to streamline data operations, enhance analytical flexibility, and preserve query efficiency, thereby broadening PostgreSQL's scope in managing diverse data types and structures. "pgpartiql" provides users with a robust tool for advanced data management within the PostgreSQL framework.

## Introduction

PostgreSQL, an open-source relational database system, stands out for its robustness and adherence to SQL standards. Despite its strengths, PostgreSQL cannot natively execute PartiQL queries, which extend SQL to manage structured, semi-structured, and nested data, thus limiting its flexibility in handling modern data types. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces a new PostgreSQL extension that facilitates the execution of PartiQL queries, thereby enhancing PostgreSQL's capability to meet contemporary data management demands.

The extension prioritizes performance and scalability when processing PartiQL queries, aiming to streamline data integration, migration, and analysis processes. By incorporating PartiQL's features into PostgreSQL, the project seeks to provide a comprehensive solution for complex data operations, leveraging PostgreSQL's dependability alongside PartiQL's versatile querying functionality.

## Background Overview

### PostgreSQL Extension Mechanism

PostgreSQL represents a sophisticated open-source object-relational database system known for its extensibility. This feature allows the integration of new functionalities, extending its native capabilities. PostgreSQL supports extensions and modules, introducing additional features like new data types, functions, operators, and indexing mechanisms. Such a framework ensures PostgreSQL's versatility across diverse data management scenarios, meeting a broad spectrum of industry demands.

### Overview of PartiQL

PartiQL enhances SQL by offering a unified query language for diverse data types, regardless of their structure or source. It builds on SQL's relational algebra, including operations on traditional relational data and non-relational models, such as nested arrays and objects. Despite introducing new functionalities, PartiQL maintains SQL's syntax, promoting user familiarity while addressing modern data management challenges.

### PostgreSQL Data Handling Limitations

PostgreSQL is highly efficient with structured, relational data but encounters limitations with non-relational data types and intricate nested structures. Traditionally, addressing these challenges involves flattening nested data or crafting custom functions, which can be inefficient and complex. These issues become more pronounced with the growing prevalence of semi-structured and unstructured data in business environments. The need for frequent context switching and additional data processing steps complicates data handling, increasing the likelihood of errors and extending development timelines.

The integration of PartiQL through a new PostgreSQL extension will overcome these hurdles. By incorporating native support for PartiQL queries, PostgreSQL will enhance its data querying and manipulation flexibility. This move aims to minimize external data processing requirements and simplify working with non-relational data. Improving PostgreSQL with this extension leverages its existing strengths and aligns it with the dynamic demands of contemporary data management, ensuring its continued relevance and versatility in various applications.

## Goals and Objectives

The primary goal of integrating PartiQL support into PostgreSQL through the "pgpartiql" extension is to enhance PostgreSQL's data querying and manipulation capabilities, making it more versatile and efficient in handling both relational and non-relational data. This section outlines the specific objectives that the "pgpartiql" extension aims to achieve:

1. **Unified Query Language**: Integrate PartiQL into PostgreSQL as a unified query language, allowing the composition of a singular query for accessing both relational and non-relational data models. This integration simplifies managing various data types and structures, lowering the learning curve. Commercial or cloud-based databases built on PostgreSQL stand to gain from this streamlined approach. In a corporate environment, a PartiQL query, due to its semantic consistency, can be executed across multiple such databases with minimal to no changes. This capability contrasts sharply with the current situation, where each database variant, despite originating from PostgreSQL, exhibits divergences in data types, operations, and behaviors, such as differences in handling decimals, strings, timestamps, and null values.

2. **Efficient Data Integration and Migration**: Simplify the data integration and migration process by providing native support for querying nested and semi-structured data. The extension will eliminate the need for cumbersome data transformation or flattening processes, facilitating smoother data flows between different systems and formats.

3. **Enhanced Analytical Capabilities**: Improve PostgreSQL's analytical capabilities by allowing direct queries on nested structures and arrays, thereby unlocking new insights from previously complex data to analyze directly in PostgreSQL. This objective aims to support more complex analytical queries and operations within the database.

4. **Performance Optimization**: Ensure that the introduction of PartiQL queries does not compromise PostgreSQL's performance. The extension will focus on optimizing query execution, minimizing overhead, and leveraging PostgreSQL's existing performance features to handle PartiQL queries efficiently.

5. **Seamless Integration**: Design the "pgpartiql" extension to integrate seamlessly with PostgreSQL's existing features and ecosystem. This extension includes compatibility with PostgreSQL's security model, transaction management, and existing tooling, ensuring users can adopt PartiQL without significant changes to their current workflows.

6. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Facilitate broader adoption of PartiQL across different computing environments supported by PostgreSQL. This adoption includes ensuring that the extension works consistently across various operating systems and cloud platforms that deploy PostgreSQL.

7. **Community and Ecosystem Support**: Engage with the PostgreSQL community to gather feedback, encourage adoption, and provide support for the extension. The goal is to foster an ecosystem around "pgpartiql" where users can share use cases, optimizations, and best practices.

By accomplishing these objectives, the "pgpartiql" extension will significantly extend PostgreSQL's capabilities, aligning it with the needs of modern, data-driven applications and making it a more powerful tool for developers and data analysts alike.

## Design and Architecture

The "pgpartiql" extension will integrate PartiQL's comprehensive querying capabilities with PostgreSQL. This integration facilitates a seamless experience for users working with complex data structures directly within their PostgreSQL databases. The architecture of "pgpartiql" is structured around several core components, each designed to translate and adapt PartiQL queries into a form that PostgreSQL can natively execute while maintaining high performance and compatibility with PostgreSQL's existing functionalities.

### Core Components

- **PartiQL Parser**: A component that interprets PartiQL syntax, preparing it for translation into PostgreSQL's SQL dialect.

- **Query Translator or Transpiler**: Central to the extension, this translates PartiQL queries into equivalent PostgreSQL SQL queries.

- **Type System Mapper**: Given the differences in data types between PartiQL and PostgreSQL, this mapper harmonizes types across the two languages, appropriately converting data types, especially during Data Definition Language (DDL) operations.

### Design Principles

- **Performance Optimization**: Ensuring that the translation and execution of PartiQL queries do not adversely affect PostgreSQL's performance. Strategies include leveraging existing PostgreSQL optimization mechanisms and introducing specific optimizations for handling PartiQL queries.

- **Seamless Integration**: The extension will integrate smoothly with PostgreSQL, requiring minimal configuration changes and allowing users to employ PartiQL queries alongside traditional SQL queries without disruption.

- **Extensibility and Maintenance**: Architecting "pgpartiql" with extensibility in mind, allowing for future enhancements to PartiQL support and easy updates to adapt to evolving PostgreSQL features.

## Implementation

Developing a PostgreSQL extension like "pgpartiql" involves detailed steps, from writing the extension code to installing and using it within a PostgreSQL database. Below is a simplified step-by-step guide, including sample code snippets, to illustrate the development process. Please note, the following is a conceptual overview - a pseudocode, if you will; implementation details might vary based on the PartiQL's Rust-based parser, PartiQL Scribe, and PostgreSQL versions.

The following diagram represents a candidate design to develop the extension:

> Given the constraints and context provided earlier, direct implementation details, especially involving specific programming languages or technologies like C, Rust, or PartiQL integration specifics, are out of scope for this paper.

### Step 1: Developing the Extension

#### A. Define the Extension's SQL Wrapper

Create a SQL file (e.g., `pgpartiql--1.0.sql`) that PostgreSQL will use to load the extension. This file should define the wrapper functions that PostgreSQL will call to interact with the PartiQL parser and Scribe translator.

```sql
-- Define a function to execute PartiQL queries
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION execute_partiql(query TEXT) RETURNS SETOF RECORD AS $$
BEGIN
    -- Placeholder for calling the PartiQL parser and Scribe translator
    -- Actual implementation will involve invoking external libraries or custom code
    RETURN QUERY EXECUTE translate_and_execute(query);
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

#### B. Implementing Translation Logic

Assuming you have a C or Python module for interfacing with PartiQL's parser and Scribe, you'll need to write a function that PostgreSQL can call. Here's a pseudo-implementation in C for a function that translates and executes a PartiQL query:

```c
#include "postgres.h"
#include "fmgr.h"
#include "utils/builtins.h"

PG_MODULE_MAGIC;

PG_FUNCTION_INFO_V1(execute_partiql);

Datum
execute_partiql(PG_FUNCTION_ARGS)
{
    char* partiql_query = TextDatumGetCString(PG_GETARG_DATUM(0));

    // Placeholder for PartiQL query translation and execution
    // This would involve calling the PartiQL parser and Scribe translator
    // and then executing the resulting SQL query against PostgreSQL

    PG_RETURN_TEXT_P(cstring_to_text("Result placeholder"));
}
```

### Step 2: Packaging the Extension

Create a control file (`pgpartiql.control`) to define the extension metadata:

```
# pgpartiql.control
name = 'pgpartiql'
default_version = '1.0'
comment = 'Execute PartiQL queries in PostgreSQL'
```

### Step 3: Installing the Extension

1. **Compile Custom Code**: If your extension includes custom C code, compile it into a shared library (`.so` file on Linux) and place it in PostgreSQL's library directory.

2. **Deploy SQL and Control Files**: Move your SQL file (`pgpartiql--1.0.sql`) and control file (`pgpartiql.control`) to the PostgreSQL's extension directory.

3. **Register the Extension**: Log into your PostgreSQL database and run:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION pgpartiql;
```

### Step 4: Using the Extension

Once installed, you can use the `execute_partiql` function to run PartiQL queries directly within PostgreSQL:

```sql
SELECT * FROM execute_partiql('SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE id > 10');
```

## Evaluation

After developing the "pgpartiql" extension, a comprehensive evaluation is essential to ensure its effectiveness, performance, and compatibility within the PostgreSQL ecosystem. This section outlines the methodologies and metrics for assessing the extension's impact on PostgreSQL's functionality and performance, especially when executing PartiQL queries.
