Compiler engineering is essential for translating high-level programming languages into machine code, a process crucial for software execution. This discipline faces unique challenges with query languages like PartiQL, which extends SQL to handle structured, semi-structured, and nested data. PartiQL's flexibility makes it indispensable for modern data management, necessitating compilers that accurately interpret and execute its queries.
Semantic analysis is a critical phase in compiler design, especially for PartiQL. It ensures queries are syntactically correct and semantically valid, aligning with the language's logic. This phase involves type checking, scope resolution, and integrity constraint enforcement, which is critical for accurate query execution across diverse data formats.

This paper focuses on semantic analysis within PartiQL compiler engineering, exploring the phase's importance in query execution. By examining compiler architecture, semantic analysis techniques, and their impact on data management, the paper contributes insights to compiler engineering for query languages, addressing modern data management challenges.
