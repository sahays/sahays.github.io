## What is it, anyway?

SQL++ is a dialect of SQL designed to enhance the language's capabilities in querying semi-structured data. It aims to bridge the gap between traditional SQL's strict, schema-based querying and the flexible, schema-less nature of modern data formats, such as JSON, commonly used in NoSQL databases. SQL++ extends SQL syntax and semantics to support nested and semi-structured data naturally, allowing for complex queries without sacrificing the expressiveness and familiarity of SQL. This extension makes SQL++ suitable for many data environments, from traditional relational databases to modern NoSQL systems, facilitating more effective data integration, analysis, and management.

## What problem does it solve?

The SQL++ paper [1] identifies a fundamental problem in data management: traditional SQL's limitations in efficiently querying semi-structured data. This challenge arises from SQL's inherent design around strict schema requirements, which needs to align better with the flexible, nested, or schema-less data formats prevalent in many modern applications and NoSQL databases. The issue is the difficulty of applying SQL's powerful querying capabilities to data that does not fit neatly into rows and columns without complex workarounds or sacrificing query expressiveness and performance. This gap between the structured query language and the evolving nature of data storage and retrieval practices hampers the ability to seamlessly integrate, analyze, and manage diverse data types within a unified query framework.

## Why worry about limitations in querying semi-structured data?

The limitations in efficiently querying semi-structured data present a significant problem for several reasons:

- **Data Variety:** Modern applications generate a wide variety of data, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured formats. The inability to efficiently query semi-structured data hinders this diverse data's comprehensive analysis and integration, limiting insights and decision-making capabilities.
- **Flexibility and Agility:** Semi-structured data formats, such as JSON or XML, are famous for their flexibility, allowing for rapid development and evolution of applications. Traditional SQL's limitations in handling such formats restrict this agility, imposing additional complexity on data management.
- **Scalability and Performance:** As data volumes grow, efficient querying mechanisms are critical. The inefficiency in querying semi-structured data can lead to performance bottlenecks, impacting the scalability of data systems and applications.
- **Integration Challenges:** Many organizations use a mix of data storage solutions, including relational databases and NoSQL systems. The difficulty in querying semi-structured data complicates the integration of these disparate data sources, hindering unified data analytics and management efforts.
- **Utilization of Data:** Semi-structured data often contains valuable, deeply nested information that traditional SQL queries cannot easily access or manipulate. This limitation constrains the full utilization of available data, reducing the effectiveness of data-driven strategies.

Addressing these limitations is crucial for enhancing data analytics, improving operational efficiency, and supporting the dynamic requirements of modern data ecosystems.

## SQL++ and the SQL standards

The SQL++ paper and the broader discussion around enhancing SQL for semi-structured data have influenced the development and adoption of several standard specifications. While the paper itself focuses on extending SQL capabilities, it aligns with the objectives of initiatives like SQL:1999 (also known as SQL3), which introduced structured types and the ability to query nested data, and JSON functions in SQL:2016, aiming to improve handling of semi-structured data within SQL.

Furthermore, the emergence of query languages like PartiQL[2], directly inspired by SQL++ principles, represents an effort to standardize querying across diverse data formats, including nested and semi-structured data. PartiQL is designed to work seamlessly with Amazon's data stores and adheres to the SQL++ vision by offering SQL-compatible querying capabilities that extend beyond traditional relational databases.

These standards and languages strive to address the SQL++ paper's identified problems by providing more flexible, powerful, and standardized ways to query and manage semi-structured data, thereby facilitating better integration, analysis, and utilization of diverse data types within modern data architectures.

## Languages that derive from SQL++

SQL implementations that follow the principles of SQL++ and aim to extend SQL's capabilities for semi-structured data, similar to PartiQL and N1QL, include:

- **PartiQL:** Developed by Amazon, PartiQL (pronounced as "particle") is a SQL-compatible query language that enables uniform data manipulation across diverse data formats and storage systems. It extends SQL to handle semi-structured and nested data, providing a standardized querying interface for relational and non-relational data.
- **N1QL:** Couchbase's N1QL (pronounced as "nickel") [3] is a query language that extends SQL for JSON data, allowing for rich and complex queries against semi-structured data. It supports CRUD operations, schema flexibility, and indexing, making it suitable for applications requiring dynamic content and personalized features.

Other notable implementations influenced by SQL++ or addressing similar challenges include:

- **AsterixDB:** A highly scalable big-data management system (BDMS) that provides a flexible data model and query language, AQL, designed to query semi-structured data. AsterixDB aims to integrate NoSQL systems' scalability features with traditional DBMS data management capabilities.
- **Apache Drill:** An open-source, schema-free SQL query engine for big-data exploration. Apache Drill [4] works with semi-structured data stored in file systems, NoSQL databases, and cloud storage. It supports various data formats, including JSON and Parquet, and allows querying data without predefined schemas.

These implementations reflect the growing need for flexible, powerful query languages capable of handling the complexity and diversity of modern data ecosystems, aligning with SQL++'s objectives to enhance SQL for semi-structured data analysis and management.

## Conclusion

The exploration of SQL++ and its impact on modern data querying reveals a significant advancement in how we interact with semi-structured and nested data. By identifying and addressing the limitations of traditional SQL in managing complex data types, SQL++ sets the stage for innovative query languages like PartiQL and N1QL. These languages extend SQL's reach beyond relational databases, offering solutions for the efficient querying and manipulation of JSON and other semi-structured data formats. PartiQL, in particular, embodies the principles of SQL++, providing a seamless, SQL-compatible language that enhances data management across AWS's diverse ecosystem. The development of SQL++ and its subsequent implementations highlight a broader movement towards flexible, powerful, and inclusive data querying capabilities, ensuring that organizations can leverage the full potential of their data assets in a rapidly evolving digital landscape. This evolution underscores the importance of adapting traditional data processing tools to meet the needs of modern data architectures, fostering more effective data integration, analysis, and management practices.
