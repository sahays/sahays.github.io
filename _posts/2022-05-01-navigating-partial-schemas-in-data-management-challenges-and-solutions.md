## Abstract

This paper discusses the concept of partial schemas within the context of data management, particularly in environments dealing with semi-structured or unstructured data. We explore the reasons leading to partial schemas, the challenges they pose, and potential solutions to manage these challenges effectively. The paper includes practical examples and Python code snippets to illustrate the implementation of these solutions.

## What is Partial Schema?

A partial schema refers to a data structure definition that does not comprehensively describe the entire dataset's schema. Instead, it specifies only a subset of the fields, types, or structure expected in the data. This approach allows for flexibility in handling data where the full schema is not known in advance, is too complex, or may vary between data instances. Partial schemas are particularly useful in scenarios involving semi-structured or unstructured data, enabling systems to process and store data without needing a complete understanding of its structure beforehand.

Partial schemas emerge in data systems that do not enforce a strict schema upfront, commonly found in NoSQL databases, data lakes, and big data processing frameworks. This flexibility allows for rapid data evolution but introduces data validation, integration, and querying complexity.

## Why is it a Problem?

Partial schemas present a complex challenge in data management due to their incomplete nature. They hinder consistent data validation, complicating the enforcement of data integrity and the detection of anomalies. Integration efforts become more intricate as systems must adapt to schema variability, impacting interoperability and increasing the complexity of data pipelines. Additionally, partial schemas can degrade query performance, as additional computations may be necessary to handle dynamic schema variations. Managing the evolution of data schemas without complete definitions requires sophisticated tracking mechanisms, elevating the risk of incompatibilities over time. Furthermore, the lack of comprehensive schemas complicates schema discovery and documentation efforts, posing significant obstacles to data governance and usability.

## Reasons Behind Partial Schemas

Partial schemas emerge due to several factors, reflecting the dynamic nature of data and the diverse processing environments. These factors contribute to the complexity of managing data, especially in systems prioritizing flexibility and scalability.

### Data Source Evolution

Data sources frequently evolve, introducing new fields or types as application requirements change. For example, a social media platform might initially gather basic user information like name and email. Over time, as the platform introduces new features, it may begin to collect additional data such as location, preferences, or social graphs. This evolution leads to a scenario where newer records contain fields absent in older records, complicating data processing and analytics. The challenge lies in maintaining consistent and efficient data processing as the schema evolves, requiring systems to dynamically adapt to the new structure without disrupting existing operations.

### Heterogeneous Data Integration

Organizations often integrate data from multiple sources, each with its unique schema. Consider a company merger where integrating customer databases reveals one database categorizes customer information differently. This integration necessitates reconciling differences in schemas, usually resulting in a superset schema that accommodates each source to some degree. Integrating heterogeneous data sources makes querying and analysis more complex, as systems must navigate the combined schema's inconsistencies.

### Agile Development Practices

Agile methodologies emphasize rapid software functionality delivery, leading to frequent updates to the data model. A web application might introduce a feature requiring additional user data collection, altering the database schema. This iterative development can cause discrepancies between data model versions, creating partial schemas. Agile development's rapid pace can result in schemas evolving faster than implementation and documentation, raising potential data integrity issues.

### Decentralized Data Production

The rise of microservices and distributed systems has decentralized data production. Different services may produce data with varying structures for a centralized system's consumption. For example, one microservice might send detailed user engagement data while another sends more generalized information. This decentralization requires centralized systems to reconcile structural differences, leading to partial schemas where data structure uniformity across all data is lacking, complicating aggregation and analysis tasks.

### Schema-less and NoSQL Databases

Schema-less databases and NoSQL systems allow records with different structures to coexist, providing flexibility for rapidly changing data models. However, this advantage naturally leads to partial schemas. A document store holding JSON objects for products might have some objects with detailed inventory data and others without. The flexibility of schema-less and NoSQL databases complicates data validation, querying, and aggregation as applications must handle data structure variability.

These reasons illustrate the challenges posed by partial schemas in data management, underscoring the need for strategies to handle the inherent complexity and variability in modern data environments. Effective data management requires a nuanced understanding of these challenges and the implementation of solutions that ensure data integrity and usability despite the evolving nature of schemas.

To further illustrate the challenges and solutions related to partial schemas, let's consider an example involving data from an e-commerce platform that integrates customer data from two sources. Over time, the schema has evolved to include additional information, leading to partial schemas within the data.

### Example: E-commerce Customer Data Integration

**Scenario:** An e-commerce platform integrates customer data from its website and a recently acquired online store. The original platform's customer records include `customer_id`, `name`, and `email` fields. The acquired store's records contain `customer_id`, `name`, `email`, and `loyalty_points`.

**Challenge**
The integration creates a partial schema scenario where some records have `loyalty_points`, and others do not. This discrepancy complicates analyses that involve loyalty points, such as segmenting customers based on loyalty points or calculating average loyalty points across the customer base.

**Solution Approach**
One approach to handling this partial schema scenario involves modifying the data processing code to accommodate missing fields. This modification can include defaults for missing data, conditional processing based on field existence, or schema evolution strategies.

**Python Code Example**
Below is a Python code snippet demonstrating handling this partial schema by assigning a default value for `loyalty_points` when missing and calculating the average loyalty points among customers.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Sample data simulating the merged customer data
data = [
    {"customer_id": 1, "name": "John Doe", "email": "john@example.com"},
    {"customer_id": 2, "name": "Jane Smith", "email": "jane@example.com", "loyalty_points": 120},
    {"customer_id": 3, "name": "Emily Jones", "email": "emily@example.com", "loyalty_points": 150},
]

# Convert to DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Assign default value for missing loyalty_points
df['loyalty_points'].fillna(0, inplace=True)

# Calculate average loyalty points
average_loyalty_points = df['loyalty_points'].mean()

print(f"Average loyalty points among customers: {average_loyalty_points}")
```

In this code, we first simulate the integrated customer data as a list of dictionaries, each representing a customer record. We then convert this list into a pandas `DataFrame` for easier manipulation. Given the partial schema (some records missing the `loyalty_points` field), we use `fillna` to assign a default value of `0` to `loyalty_points` for records where this field is missing. Finally, we calculate and print the average loyalty points across all customer records.

This example and code snippet demonstrate a practical approach to managing partial schemas by ensuring data consistency through default values, enabling further analysis or processing without data integrity issues.

## Challenges posted by Partial Schema

Partial schemas present significant data management and processing challenges, particularly in environments where data integration and schema evolution are standard. These challenges arise from the heterogeneity and inconsistency of data formats across different sources or over time. Below, we illustrate these challenges through examples and explain their implications.

### Challenge 1: Data Integration from Multiple Sources

**Example:** Consider a scenario where a data analytics team needs to integrate customer data from two different systems: an online sales platform and a brick-and-mortar sales system. The online platform includes detailed customer profiles, including `email` and `purchase_history`, while the brick-and-mortar system records only `customer_id` and `purchase_amount`.

**Implications:** Integrating these two data sources poses a challenge due to the partial overlap in the schema. Analysis that requires complete customer profiles, such as personalized marketing campaigns, becomes complicated. The team must devise strategies to handle missing information, potentially leading to inaccurate or incomplete insights.

### Challenge 2: Schema Evolution Over Time

**Example:** A streaming service records viewer activity, initially capturing `user_id`, `view_date`, and `content_id`. Over time, the service updates the schema to include `device_type` and `watch_duration` to understand viewing habits better.

**Implications:** Analyses conducted on historical data become challenging due to the absence of `device_type` and `watch_duration` in earlier records. This partial schema complicates trend analysis over time, as any insights into viewing habits by device type or engagement level are inherently incomplete for the period before the schema update.

### Challenge 3: Query Complexity and Performance

**Example:** A business intelligence application queries a database that has evolved to include optional fields in customer records, such as `secondary_email` and `membership_status`. These fields are not present in all records.

**Implications:** Queries that attempt to utilize these optional fields must account for their potential absence, increasing query complexity. This attempt can lead to slower query performance and increased development time as engineers write more complex code to handle these scenarios.

### Challenge 4: Data Consistency and Quality

**Example:** An e-commerce platform merges user data from its original site and an acquired competitor. The competitor's user data includes a `loyalty_points` field, which does not exist in the original platform's data.

**Implications:** This leads to inconsistency in user records, where some have `loyalty_points` and others do not. Calculating metrics like average loyalty points or segmenting users based on loyalty becomes problematic, affecting the quality of business insights and potentially leading to misguided decisions.

These examples highlight the multifaceted challenges posed by partial schemas, impacting data integration, analysis, and the overall quality of data-driven decisions. Addressing these challenges requires careful planning, including adopting flexible data models, implementing schema evolution strategies, and utilizing data processing techniques that accommodate schema variability.

## Solutions to Manage Partial Schema

Various strategies can help manage the challenges posed by partial schemas effectively, focusing on flexibility, adaptability, and robust data processing practices. Following are some hands-on solutions with examples and Python code.

### Solution 1: Schema Evolution Management

**Strategy:** Implement versioning of schemas to keep track of changes over time, ensuring backward compatibility and smooth transitions between schema versions.
**Example:** A data management system stores customer data. Initially, the schema includes `name` and `email`. Later, `phone_number` is added.
**Code Example:**

```python
from pyspark.sql.functions import lit
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# Initialize SparkSession
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("SchemaEvolutionExample").getOrCreate()

# Schema Version 1
data_v1 = [("John Doe", "john.doe@example.com")]
schema_v1 = ["name", "email"]
df_v1 = spark.createDataFrame(data_v1, schema=schema_v1)

# Schema Version 2 (with phone_number)
data_v2 = [("Jane Doe", "jane.doe@example.com", "123-456-7890")]
schema_v2 = ["name", "email", "phone_number"]
df_v2 = spark.createDataFrame(data_v2, schema=schema_v2)

# Merge dataframes with different schemas, adding phone_number as null for df_v1 records
df_merged = df_v1.withColumn("phone_number", lit(None)).unionByName(df_v2)

df_merged.show()
```

### Solution 2: Flexible Data Storage and Querying

**Strategy:** Use data storage formats and systems that support schema-on-read, allowing for flexible schema interpretation at query time.
**Example:** Storing data in a format like JSON within a NoSQL database or a data lake enables storing semi-structured data with varying schemas.
**Code Example:**

```python
# Assuming data is stored in a NoSQL database or a data lake that supports schema-on-read

# Sample JSON data with partial schema
data_json = [
    '{"name": "John Doe", "email": "john.doe@example.com"}',
    '{"name": "Jane Doe", "email": "jane.doe@example.com", "phone_number": "123-456-7890"}'
]

# Querying and handling partial schema in Python
import json

# Load data
data_loaded = [json.loads(record) for record in data_json]

# Normalize data to handle partial schema
for record in data_loaded:
    record.setdefault("phone_number", None)

print(data_loaded)
```

### Solution 3: Dynamic Schema Adaptation

**Strategy:** Develop systems and tools that dynamically adapt to schema variations, allowing applications to seamlessly handle data with partial schemas.
**Example:** A streaming data processing application dynamically adjusts to incoming data streams with varying fields.
**Code Example:**

```python
# Example using a hypothetical streaming data processing library

def process_stream(data_stream):
    # Dynamically adapt to the schema of each record
    for record in data_stream:
        # Ensure default values for missing fields
        record.setdefault("phone_number", None)
        # Process record
        print(f"Processing record: {record}")

# Simulated data stream with varying schema
data_stream = [
    {"name": "John Doe", "email": "john.doe@example.com"},
    {"name": "Jane Doe", "email": "jane.doe@example.com", "phone_number": "123-456-7890"}
]

process_stream(data_stream)
```

These solutions demonstrate practical approaches to managing partial schemas, leveraging schema evolution techniques, flexible data storage, and dynamic schema adaptation to mitigate their challenges. By implementing these strategies, organizations can enhance their ability to integrate diverse data sources, accommodate schema changes, and ensure robust data processing capabilities.

### Pitfalls

While the strategies outlined offer robust solutions for managing partial schemas, they may fall short in some scenarios. Implementing schema evolution or dynamic schema adaptation can introduce complexities that outweigh their benefits in environments with highly rigid data validation requirements or legacy systems that strictly enforce a fixed schema. For instance, systems that depend on real-time data consistency checks or where data integrity is paramount may not tolerate the flexibility these solutions provide. Additionally, in cases where data sources are too diverse, or the rate of schema changes is excessively high, maintaining versioning and compatibility can become impractical. Moreover, these solutions require technical sophistication and tooling support, which might only be available or feasible in some environments. In such contexts, alternative approaches might be necessary, such as redesigning the data intake and processing architecture to minimize schema variability or employing more traditional ETL processes to standardize data before ingestion.

Incorporating the impact on storage and compute costs, these scenarios further complicate the resource management aspect. Implementing schema evolution or dynamic schema adaptation requires additional compute resources to handle schema merging, validation, and conversion processes. It increases storage requirements to maintain multiple schema versions or metadata for schema resolution. As data volumes grow and schema changes become more frequent, the overhead associated with these processes can significantly escalate, impacting operational costs and system performance. For example, maintaining backward or forward compatibility through schema versioning necessitates additional storage to keep historical schema versions alongside the data, increasing the storage footprint. Similarly, dynamic schema handling involves runtime schema resolution, which can lead to higher compute utilization, especially in processing large datasets or complex schema transformations. These cost implications must be carefully weighed against the benefits of flexibility and adaptability in schema management, particularly in environments where resource constraints are critical.

## Available Open-Source Projects

Several open-source projects offer robust solutions for managing the challenges of partial schemas and enhancing data integration, processing, and governance. Apache Avro and Apache Parquet provide systems for data serialization and efficient columnar storage, respectively, with solid support for schema evolution. Confluent's Schema Registry manages schema compatibility and evolution, ensuring consistent data exchange. Apache Calcite facilitates flexible query processing and schema discovery. At the same time, Apache Iceberg and Apache Arrow offer advanced table formats and in-memory data processing capabilities, supporting complex nested structures and schema evolution. Together, these tools form a comprehensive ecosystem for addressing the intricacies of partial schemas, enabling organizations to maintain data integrity, performance, and flexibility in dynamic data environments.

## How can PartiQL Help?

PartiQL [1] offers a candidate solution for querying data with partial schemas, addressing the complexities of semi-structured and nested data. Its design fundamentally embraces the variability inherent in modern data formats, distinguishing itself through the nuanced treatment of absent values and a flexible data model. Unlike traditional SQL, PartiQL introduces `MISSING` alongside `NULL` [2], a differentiation that allows for querying within datasets with partial schema. This distinction is crucial for handling partial schemas, as it enables queries to explicitly account for absent fields without conflating them with fields that are present but null.

The PartiQL data model's compatibility with arrays, bags, and scalar values, enriched by its integration with the Ion type system, further enhances its capability to manage semi-structured data. This flexibility allows for seamless data querying regardless of its conformity to a rigid schema, making PartiQL particularly adept at navigating the challenges posed by data evolution and integration from heterogeneous sources.

By leveraging PartiQL, developers and data analysts can effectively construct expressive queries that navigate and manipulate data with partial schemas. Operations on datasets that include nested and optional fields become straightforward, mitigating the issues traditionally associated with schema variability. This capability ensures that data stored in non-traditional formats or undergoing schema evolution remains accessible and usable, providing a robust toolset for the dynamic requirements of modern data processing and analysis.

## Summary

In conclusion, managing partial schemas presents significant challenges and opportunities for modern data architectures. While the flexibility to accommodate schema evolution and variability is essential in dealing with the dynamic nature of big data, it introduces complexities in data processing, integrity, and system design. The solutions discussed, including schema evolution, schema-on-read strategies, and schema registries, offer pathways to address these challenges, yet they still need limitations. Key among these is the potential impact on storage and compute costs and the feasibility of implementation in rigid or legacy systems. It becomes clear that while strategies for managing partial schemas can significantly enhance data agility and system scalability, they necessitate carefully considering the trade-offs involved. Organizations must assess their needs, data characteristics, and system capabilities to determine the most effective approach, balancing flexibility with cost, performance, and data integrity requirements. As data ecosystems evolve, managing partial schemas will remain critical for innovation and optimization, requiring ongoing adaptation and thoughtful strategy development.
