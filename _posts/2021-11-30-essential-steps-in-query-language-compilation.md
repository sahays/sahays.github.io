Compilers translate high-level programming languages into machine code, allowing computers to execute written programs. They perform this translation through several stages, including lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, optimization, and code generation.

A compiler aims to bridge the gap between human-readable code and machine-executable instructions, optimizing the code for performance and efficiency along the way. For example, a compiler transforms a C program that calculates the factorial of a number into a sequence of assembly instructions that the computer's processor can execute directly, ensuring the program runs as intended on the hardware.

The same compilation concepts and steps apply to develop a query language, e.g., PartiQL or Trino.

The compilation and evaluation steps for queries in languages like PartiQL are crucial for processing and interpreting user requests across various data environments. These steps transform user queries from a human-readable format into a logical plan that systems can evaluate to produce results. The necessity for these steps arises from several fundamental requirements:

- **Correctness:** Ensuring queries are syntactically and semantically correct. This correctness guarantees an accurate representation of the user's intent and executable queries within the system's framework. For example, semantic analysis checks if `SELECT age FROM employees` references a valid `age` column in `employees`.
- **Efficiency:** Optimizing queries through transformation and logical planning allows systems to process requests faster and more resource-efficiently. For instance, query optimization might reorder a query `SELECT name FROM employees WHERE department = 'HR' AND age > 30` to first filter on the more selective condition, such as `age > 30` if it is determined to reduce the search space more significantly.
- **Flexibility:** These steps enable query languages to abstract from physical storage details, allowing the same query to run across different storage systems without user modification. An example is transforming `SELECT * FROM logs WHERE date > '2022-01-01'` into a logical plan that can be applied whether `logs` are stored in a SQL database, a NoSQL document store, or a distributed file system.
- **Interoperability:** A standardized process ensures that queries can be executed in diverse environments, enhancing the portability of applications. For example, a logical plan for `SELECT id, COUNT(*) FROM transactions GROUP BY id` can be evaluated in a traditional database or a stream-processing system, allowing the same analytics logic in batch or real-time contexts.

These methodologies are rooted in computer science, specifically in compilers, databases, and algorithms, leveraging unique data structures and algorithms:

- **Lexical Analysis** uses finite automata to tokenize input text, breaking down `SELECT * FROM table WHERE condition` into tokens like `SELECT`, `*`, `FROM`, `table`, `WHERE`, and `condition`.
- **Syntax Analysis** employs parsing algorithms to construct a parse tree, ensuring the query `INSERT INTO employees (name, age) VALUES ('John', 30)` adheres to the correct format of an `INSERT` statement.
- **Semantic Analysis** relies on symbol tables to validate the semantic correctness of `UPDATE employees SET age = age + 1 WHERE id = 5`, ensuring `age` and `id` are valid columns.
- **Query Transformation and Optimization** utilize algorithms to rewrite `SELECT name FROM employees WHERE department = 'HR' OR age < 25` for efficiency, perhaps by applying an index on `department` or `age` if available.
- **Logical Plan Generation and Evaluation** involve creating data flow plans for `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders GROUP BY customerId`, using data structures like hash tables for aggregation.

This diagram starts with the initial state, proceeding through the stages of lexical analysis (tokenizing the input code), syntax analysis (parsing the tokens into a parse tree), semantic analysis (checking for semantic correctness), optimization (improving the code for better performance), and finally code generation (producing the machine code). Each stage is a critical step in the compilation process, transforming high-level code into optimized machine code executable by a computer.
